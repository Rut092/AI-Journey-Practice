# 🚀 AI Mastery Journey

This repository tracks my end-to-end journey from Machine Learning to Generative AI. I am following a curated path of deep-dive articles to build mastery through theory and practice.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

## 💡 How I'm Learning
- **Active Reading:** Focusing on "Intuition Math" over memorizing formulas.
- **Implementation:** Writing 5-10 lines of code for every major concept.
- **Consistency:** One article, one concept, and one code snippet per day.
